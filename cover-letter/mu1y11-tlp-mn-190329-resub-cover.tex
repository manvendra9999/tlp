\opening{Dear Lucio,
}
Please find enclosed our revised manuscript titled
``Modular transmission line probes for microfluidic nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging'', which we submit for publication
in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance.
We are grateful to the reviewers for their careful evaluation of the manuscript
and for their constructive comments. We have revised the manuscript
in response to their specific concerns
as detailed in a separate document, and
we are confident that these changes adequately address their concerns.


\closing{With best wishes,}
